# Electronic Health Records (EHR) System

## Project Overview
This project addresses the real-world problem of inefficient management of medical records at local clinics, leading to delays in patient care and errors in treatment. The solution is a secure, accessible, and real-time Electronic Health Records (EHR) system, developed using Agile Scrum methodology.

## Problem Statement
Many healthcare providers suffer from outdated or fragmented patient information, resulting in poor healthcare delivery. Our goal is to centralize, secure, and streamline patient information management to improve efficiency and quality of care.

## Solution
Develop a comprehensive EHR system that:
- Integrates patient data securely
- Enables real-time updates
- Facilitates appointment scheduling
- Tracks patient medical history
- Manages billing information

## Team Structure
- **Scrum Master**: Facilitates the Agile process
- **Product Owner**: Prioritizes business value
- **Development Team**: Developers, Testers, UX/UI Designers

## Key Features (Epics)
- Patient Information Management
- Appointment Scheduling
- Medical History Tracking
- Billing and Invoicing Integration
- Security and Compliance

## Agile Methodology Approach
- **Requirements Management**: PICs and Minimally Releasable Features (MRF) identified
- **User Stories**: Broken down, sized using Planning Poker
- **Sprint Planning**: Top priority user stories planned with acceptance criteria
- **Prototyping**: Iterative sprint cycles, continuous feedback and adaptation

## Example User Story
> As a receptionist, I want to register new patients electronically so that their information is securely stored and easily accessible.

## Acceptance Criteria Example
- Verify that patient name, contact, and medical history fields are captured correctly.
- Check that the system validates mandatory inputs.
- Calculate storage utilization after patient data entry.
- Verify secure database connection after registration.
